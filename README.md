# Casually Components

## Overview
Delightfully easy-use, and customizable **smart components** for Svelte, React, Vue, Solid, and Angular. Transcend Bootstrap and Material-esque common looks with beautiful, craft-grade textured skins.

All components are coded from scratch with pure CSS, SVG, or generative JS. Use of assets such as fonts are  coded into the barebones of the component.  

**No external dependencies** apart from framework core libraries.  
**No external links**.
