# Casually Components (Old Monorepo)

## Dev's Note

#### This component library is deprecated. Components of all framework libraries will continue to be available but discouraged for public use as modules are in premature stage. Security and accessibility features aren't incorporated.

**Project is migrating to the [new Casually Components repository](https://github.com/andreaabellera/Casually-Components) as a single distribution of native web components**


## Overview
Delightfully easy-use, and customizable **smart components** for Svelte, React, Vue, Solid, Lit, and Angular. Transcend Bootstrap and Material-esque common looks with beautiful, craft-grade textured skins.

All components are coded from scratch with pure CSS, SVG, or generative JS. Use of assets such as fonts are  coded into the barebones of the component.  

**No external dependencies** apart from framework core libraries.  
**No external links**.

## All I want after Christmas
- Get base component integrations working
- Prepare component variations for all skins
- Launch play site
- Smart framework detection, or a way to set framework context. If not possible, work with scoped packages
- Add complex components such as a Form suite, Roadmap, Timeline, Calendar
